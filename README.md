# rhtmlLabeledScatter
An HTML widget that creates a labeled scatter plot

# Installation in R

1. `library(devtools)`
1. `install_github('NumbersInternational/rhtmlLabeledScatter')`

Simplest Example to verify installation:

```
rhtmlLabeledScatter::template()
```


# Local Installation to Develop/Contribute

**Prerequisites** - For help installing prerequisites see the `Prequisite Installation Help` section below

1. nodejs >= 5.0
1. python 2.7 - one of the nodejs libraries needs python during the installation process

## Installing the rhtmlLabeledScatter code

1. On windows open git shell (or install it first). On OSX open terminal
    1. Tim note : Type enter when prompted for a passphrase when opening git shell
1. Change directory to the place where you put git projects
    1. Tim note : Do not use a Dropbox synced directory. There will be 1000's of files created by `npm install` and your computer will catch fire
1. type `git clone git@github.com:NumbersInternational/rhtmlLabeledScatter.git` ENTER
1. type `cd rhtmlLabeledScatter` ENTER
1. type `npm install` ENTER
    1. `npm install` is noisy and will print several warnings about `UNMET` and `DEPRECATED`. Ignore these and only make note of errors. If it fails, try running it again.
1. type `gulp serve` ENTER
    1. If `gulp serve` does not work try `./node_modules/.bin/gulp serve`. To correct this and to make your nodejs life easier you should add `./node_modules/.bin` to your PATH. Consult the Internet for instructions on how to do so on your OS of choice.

If this worked, then the `gulp serve` command opened your browser and you are looking at `http://localhost:9000`. You should see a page listing a bunch of links to examples, each example shows the simple 4 square widget template. These examples are defined in the [features.json file](theSrc/features/features.json).

Choose an example or add another example to [features.json](theSrc/features/features.json). When changes to any file in `./theSrc` are saved, the browser will automatically reload.

# Developing and Contributing

See docs on the [htmlwidget_build_system](docs/htmlwidget_build_system.md) to understand what gulp tasks are available and to understand the role of each file in the project. Here are a few important notes (both detailed in the htmlwidget_build_system docs) you must keep in mind:

1. The last thing you do before committing is run `gulp build` to ensure all the autogenerated files are up to date.
2. (With some exceptions) ONLY EDIT THINGS IN these directories: `theSrc`, and `docs` !! Many of the other files are auto generated based on the contents of `theSrc`. As an example, if you edit `R/rhtmlTemplate.R` and then run `gulp build` your changes will be DELETED FOREVER!, because `R/rhtmlTemplate.R` is just a copy of `theSrc/R/htmlwidget.R`. See [htmlwidget_build_system](docs/htmlwidget_build_system.md) for more details.

# Docs

**Doc manifest**
* [htmlwidget build system](docs/htmlwidget_build_system.md) - gulp task descriptions and file role breakdown
* [extending the template](docs/extending_the_template.md) - instructions on using the template to create a new htmlwidget project
* [how the code works](docs/how_the_code_works.md) - a walkthrough of how the rhtmlTemplate and its successors actually work

## R docs

The [R file](theSrc/R/htmlwidget.R) has inline documentation that is compiled into an [Rd file](man/template.Rd). This documentation can be accessed from R using the following sequence:

```
install_github("NumbersInternational/rhtmlTemplate")
library(rhtmlTemplate)
help(template)
```

## R Examples

There are example widget use in R in the [features.R file](examples/features.R), which is autogenerated based on the features and scenarios defined in the [features.json file](theSrc/features/features.json).

## TODO
- Bug: new rows begin blank
- Create arrow pointing to removed pts with footnote numbering
- Fixed aspect ratio option
- Fix yaml file when it is time to test in RStudio
