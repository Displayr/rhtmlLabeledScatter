 # TEMPLATE! - update the method signature here
 #  -You will need to update most of this file, as this is where all the specific widget stuff goes
 #  -Simplest way to make a new widget is to extend RhtmlStatefulWidget (which also gives you RhtmlSvgWidget)
 #   then rewrite _processConfig and

class LabeledScatter extends RhtmlSvgWidget
